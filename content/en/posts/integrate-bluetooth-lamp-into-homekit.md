## I. The Challenge: Making a "Basic" Ceiling Light Smart

Recently, I replaced my living room ceiling light with a new model. This light supports both remote and mobile app control, making it appear smart. However, it lacks integration with Mi Home or HomeKit.
After research, I discovered that the premium version of the same brand supports Mi Home control, while my basic version doesn't - a price difference of approximately 100 RMB.

As a developer, I approached this from first principles: Since the mobile app requires Bluetooth permissions, it must use Bluetooth for communication. If it's Bluetooth-controlled, it can theoretically be controlled by other Bluetooth applications and integrated into smart home ecosystems.

**Note:** For those interested in implementing this solution, refer to my detailed tutorial: [Tutorial: Make Your Non-Smart Bluetooth Light Work with HomeKit](./integrate-bluetooth-lamp-into-homekit-step-by-step)

## II. Exploration: Home Assistant and Bluetooth Control Solutions

I began researching potential solutions. Since direct Mi Home integration wasn't possible, I explored alternative approaches. This led me to discover `Home Assistant` (HA).

- [`Home Assistant`](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
> Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts.

I discovered that `Home Assistant` includes a `HomeKit Bridge` component that can bridge various non-HomeKit devices to HomeKit. This opened up new possibilities.

Further research in the `Home Assistant` community led me to `ha-ble-adv`, a solution specifically designed for Bluetooth integration.

- [Convert a "smart" chinese lamp to a real smart lamp](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/convert-a-smart-chinese-lamp-to-a-real-smart-lamp/560607/1)
- [Controlling BLE ceiling light with HA](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/controlling-ble-ceiling-light-with-ha/520612/1)

This led to a clear implementation plan:
1. Control the Bluetooth light via `ha-ble-adv`
2. Manage `ha-ble-adv` through `Home Assistant`
3. Integrate with HomeKit using `Home Assistant`'s `HomeKit Bridge`

## III. Implementation: Docker Environment Challenges

With the theory validated, I began implementation. I started by setting up `Home Assistant`:
1. Install `Home Assistant`
2. Install `Home Assistant` Community Store (HACS)
3. Install `ha-ble-adv` via HACS

The first challenge emerged when attempting to connect the Bluetooth light: **Bluetooth adapter not found**.
Research revealed that `Home Assistant` running in `Docker` cannot access host machine's Bluetooth devices. Most tutorials focus on Linux environments.
I found a solution:
> Easiest way to handle bluetooth (basically regardless of how you're running HA) is to use an ESPHome BT proxy. Spend $5 on a ESP32, flash the BT proxy firmware, and you magically have bluetooth connectivity wherever you place your ESP(s)
> -- Reddit: [Is bluetooth possible for docker in Mac?](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1hpyhlq/is_bluetooth_possible_for_docker_in_mac/)

Additionally, `ha-ble-adv` doesn't support native `macOS` Bluetooth devices, as documented in this [issue](https://github.com/NicoIIT/ha-ble-adv/discussions/33).

I purchased an `ESP32` board for 25 RMB as the simplest solution.

### 3.1 Initial ESP32 Setup: Wi-Fi Configuration

I began configuring the `ESP32`. The `ha-ble-adv` documentation recommended using `esphome-ble_adv_proxy` as the Bluetooth proxy.

{{<image name="ha-ble-adv-arch02" >}}

Following the documentation:
1. Install ESPHome for `ESP32` configuration and `Home Assistant` integration
2. Connect the `ESP32` board via ESPHome
3. Flash the `ble_adv_proxy` component

The second challenge appeared: **Board remained offline after connection**.
ESPHome documentation revealed that most `ESP32` models only support 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. Adjusting the Wi-Fi settings resolved the issue.

The `ESP32` successfully connected to `ble_adv_proxy`. The Debug webpage showed it receiving Bluetooth signals from the environment.

### 3.2 ESP32 Home Assistant Integration: mDNS Resolution

The next step was integrating ESPHome with `Home Assistant` for `ha-ble-adv` to utilize the `ble_adv_proxy`.

ESPHome documentation indicated automatic discovery of the `ESP32` device. However, the third challenge emerged: **ESP32 addition failed**.
Automatic discovery failed, and manual addition using the `.local` address also failed.
I attempted troubleshooting: Would using the IP address directly work?
Given the `Docker` deployment, the container might not resolve the `ESP32`'s `.local` address. I added `extra_hosts` to the `Home Assistant` `Docker` configuration:
```
    extra_hosts:
    - "esp32.local:192.168.50.66" # Map esp32.local to its IP address
```

Note: The automatic discovery failure indicated a deeper issue - mDNS service discovery protocol malfunction. This is a common issue in `Docker` deployments and affected subsequent operations.

After restarting `Home Assistant`, the device connected successfully using the `.local` address.

### 3.3 `ha-ble-adv` Configuration

With successful device addition, `ha-ble-adv` recognized the `ESP32` as a Bluetooth adapter.
The fourth challenge appeared: **`ha-ble-adv` configuration page inaccessible**.
Debug logs showed a Python code error. After extensive troubleshooting, I filed an [issue](https://github.com/NicoIIT/ha-ble-adv/discussions/30).
The author responded quickly and fixed the error.

After updating `ha-ble-adv`, I successfully accessed the configuration page and configured the Bluetooth ceiling light.
First milestone achieved: controlling the ceiling light via the `ESP32` Bluetooth device!
This enabled `Home Assistant` control of the light's power state and brightness.

## IV. Final Challenge: HomeKit Bridge Integration

The final step was adding the `HomeKit Bridge` to integrate the light into Apple's HomeKit ecosystem.
I expected this to be straightforward - enable the `HomeKit Bridge` component and add it in the Home app.
The final and most challenging obstacle appeared: **HomeKit Bridge addition failed**. This issue persisted for three days.

I researched extensively, consulting community posts and documentation.
The problem pointed to network configuration. I investigated:
- `Docker`'s `network_mode` settings
- mDNS network configurations
- HomeKit network requirements
- Wi-Fi network settings

I attempted reinstalling `Home Assistant` and adjusting various `Docker` configurations.
Many users reported similar network issues in `Docker` environments, particularly with mDNS and HomeKit.

## V. Solution: Native Deployment

I decided to remove `Docker` and deploy `Home Assistant` natively on `macOS`.
The results were immediate:
1. `Home Assistant` automatically recognized and enabled the `macOS` host's Bluetooth adapter
2. `Home Assistant` automatically discovered the `ESP32` after ESPHome connection

Each step proceeded smoothly, with results matching expectations.
Finally, adding the `HomeKit Bridge` to HomeKit succeeded! ðŸŽ‰

I can now control the ceiling light through the iPhone's "Home" app or via `Siri`! Power control and brightness adjustment work as expected.

## VI. Summary

Despite challenges, I successfully integrated the "non-smart" ceiling light into HomeKit using an `ESP32` (25 RMB), saving approximately 100 RMB compared to the Mi Home version. This solution provided both technical value and cost efficiency.

### Limitations:
The `ble-adv` solution has several limitations:
1. Requires continuous `Home Assistant` operation
2. Requires persistent `ESP32` connection
3. Cannot track current state - e.g., if the light is turned off via remote, the phone app still shows it as on
