      <description>It is hard to choose a suitable static website generator, especially when you want to build website like blog for the first time. This is my first time to build a blog and have not enough time to go through some popular generators, which I have chosen Jekyll at the beginning but it is not a best one. In the future I am going to try another generators.
Here is some brief information I found from Google and hope it should be useful for you to decide starting up on what generator.</description>

      <description>Goal Support multi-language, mainly in English and supplemented by Chinese; When visiting pages begin with /, e.g. /about.html, /posts/hello-world, English pages would be shown; When visiting pages began with /zh/, e.g. /zh/about.html, /zh/posts/hello-world, Chinese pages would be shown; When visiting ../hello-world posts, corresponding langugage posts would be jumped via the link; Posts which are specified language would only be shown in archive and index pages. Defect As 404.html page was not supported for separate language file, two langugage content would be shown on it at the same time.</description>
